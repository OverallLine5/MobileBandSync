UWP mobile app to sync, view and export GPS based workouts tracked with the Microsoft Band

This app supports Windows 10 Mobile and lets you continue tracking workouts with the device. 
No smartphone is necessary as the app is able to download and analyze the sensor log created 
by the Microsoft Band. At the moment, only GPS based workouts such as biking, running and 
walking can be detected. To track a walking workout, simply use the running tile as the hiking tile 
seems to have major GPS problems, probably because the power saving GPS is used.

It is possible to export the database where the workouts are stored, and you can export each
workout to Garmin Training Center file format (TCX) files.

I hope that I will find the time to add some more features like showing sleep tracking results 
or filtering the list of workouts.
